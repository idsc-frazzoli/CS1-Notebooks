    "# Frequency Response Recap\n",

    "## Key Concept: System Response to Sinusoidal Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems have a fundamental property: when excited by a sinusoidal input, their output is also sinusoidal with:\n",
    "- Same frequency as the input\n",
    "- Modified amplitude\n",
    "- Shifted phase\n",
    "\n",
    "A sinusoidal input can be written as:\n",
    "$$u(t) = e^{j\\omega t} + e^{-j\\omega t} = 2\\cos(\\omega t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a system with transfer function $G(s)$, the output is:\n",
    "$$y(t) = G(j\\omega)e^{j\\omega t} + G(-j\\omega)e^{-j\\omega t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Euler's formula, this simplifies to:\n",
    "$$y(t) = |G(j\\omega)|\\cos(\\omega t + \\angle G(j\\omega))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1. **Magnitude Response**: $|G(j\\omega)|$\n",
    "   - Ratio of output amplitude to input amplitude\n",
    "   - How much the system amplifies/attenuates the input\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase Response**: $\\angle G(j\\omega)$\n",
    "   - Time shift between input and output\n",
    "   - How much the system delays/advances the signal\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, the magnitude and phase responses are functions of the input frequency $\\omega$. The frequency response of a system is the collection of these responses for all possible input frequencies. Therefore, it is very useful to plot the magnitude and phase responses as functions of frequency, as it will give us a good understanding of how the system behaves for different input frequencies and also give us a good insight into the stability of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first intuitive thinking on how to plot the frequency response of a system is to evaluate the transfer function at different frequencies and plot the magnitude and phase of the transfer function. "

    "- $\\omega_0$ is assumed to be positive. If $\\omega_0$ is negative, the magnitude remains the same, but the phase is reversed.\n",

    "- Any peaks for $\\zeta > 0.5$ are typically too small to plot and may be ignored. For underdamped poles and zeros, peaks exist when $0 \\leq \\zeta \\leq 0.707 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, though the peak frequency is slightly offset from $\\omega_0$ (at $\\omega_{\\text{peak}} = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1 - 2\\zeta^2}$).\n",
    "- For higher-order poles or zeros, adjust asymptotes, peaks, and slopes proportionally to the order. For example, a double pole results in a high-frequency asymptote at $-40$ dB/decade, with the phase moving from $0^\\circ$ to $-180^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have drawn each term of the transfer function according to these rules, you can simply add them up to get the full Bode plot of the transfer function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start with the static gain $K$. Below, you can see the point $H(s) = K$ plotted on the imaginary plane and next to it the corresponding Bode plot. As you change K, the magnitude, which is the distance to the origin, changes, and you can observe the effect on the magnitude Bode plot. The phase Bode plot only changes when we pass the point where $K=0$ and we go from positive to negative and vice-versa, getting a phase of $0\\degree$ or $180\\degree$ respectively.\n"

    "The polar plot is a way to represent the frequency response of a system by plotting $G(j\\omega)$ on the complex plane, where each point on the plot corresponds to a specific frequency $\\omega$. Unlike Bode plots, which separate magnitude and phase into two distinct graphs, the polar plot combines both aspects into a single, unified representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there are no unique rules specifically for drawing the polar plot, the principles from the Bode plot still apply, making it helpful to sketch the Bode plot first. This preliminary step offers insight into how the magnitude and phase behave across frequencies, providing a clearer picture of what the polar plot might look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interpreting the polar plot, two features are particularly significant:\n",
    "- **Intersection with the unit circle**: The point where $|G(j\\omega)| = 1$ indicates where the magnitude of the frequency response equals one. This is often of interest in stability analysis.\n",
    "- **Crossing the negative real axis**: This occurs where $\\angle G(j\\omega) = \\pm 180^\\circ$, representing points of potential phase instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week, we will introduce the Nyquist plot, and extension of the polar plot, which uses these features as a powerful tool for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, you can plot the polar plot and the corresponding Bode plot below to get a feeling of how it looks for different transfer functions."
