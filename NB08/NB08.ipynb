    "One of the course objectives is to be able to assess and design the properties of closed-loop systems. One approach of doing this, is by leveraging the knowledge of the open-loop system. In general, there are three methods of doing so:\n",
    "1. Root Locus\n",
    "2. Nyquist Plots\n",
    "3. Bode Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have covered the root locus, and how it can be used to assess design feasibility considering both stability and time specifications of a system. However, consider that there may also be frequency specifications to a system -- e.g., if a vehicle rides over some bumps, it would be undesirable if the vehicle then had oscillations of a large magnitude (i.e., if a vehicle is excited by a sinusoidal input, we wish for the output response to be small in magnitude). Thus, this motivates the introduction of the frequency response and the tools we can use to analyze it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, the bode and polar plot is introduced. Then in the following weeks, will follow with the Nyquist plot (an extension of the polar plot), and then frequency specifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to first contextualize how we investigate the frequency response of an LTI system, below we first recall a fundamental relationship between the input signal and output response of an LTI system."

Unlike Bode plots, which separate magnitude and phase into two distinct graphs, the polar plot combines both aspects into a single, unified representation. \n",

This preliminary step offers insight into how the magnitude and phase behave across frequencies, providing a clearer picture of what the polar plot might look like.\n",

    "When interpreting the polar plot, two features are particularly significant:\n",
    "- **Intersection with the unit circle**: The point where $|G(j\\omega)| = 1$ indicates where the magnitude of the frequency response equals one. This is often of interest in stability analysis.\n",
