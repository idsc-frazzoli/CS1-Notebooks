As such, two of the course objectives are to understand how analyze and synthesize systems to achieve some goal (consider the cruise-examples examples in [Supporting Notebook 1](https://github.com/idsc-frazzoli/CS1-Notebooks/blob/12c89d0f00aabcf2a7d53bd9e1a78dc2f6b96bf4/supporting_notebooks/SB2401.ipynb)). However, to do so, we first need to understand how such systems can be represented mathematically (i.e., modeled).\n",

    "First we define some relevant terminology:\n",
    "1. **Inputs:** The inputs to a system define how the outside world affects the system itself. This includes both, factors from the general environment and that of the user (who may have the goal of controlling the system for a specific task).   \n",
    "For example while controlling the temperature of water in a faucet, it is affected by both the user controlling the knob and the heat dissipation in the plumbing.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Inputs can be separated into:\n",
    "   * **Endogenous inputs**: Inputs that can be controlled. These are in general the control inputs (for example the faucet knob or the gas throttle in a car).\n",
    "   * **Exogenous inputs**: Inputs that the user has no control over. These are what we will refer to as **disturbances** (for example wind turbulence when flying a helicopter is a disturbance).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outputs:** The outputs of a system are the measurements or observations we make of the system. \n",
    "   These can be separated in:\n",
    "   * **Measured outputs**, quantities we can measure directly (e.g., the speed of a car).\n",
    "   * **Performance outputs**, which we can't measure directly but would also like to control (e.g., the average fuel efficiency of a car).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System State/memory:**\n",
    "The **memory** of a system, summarizes the effects of all past inputs. We will refer to this as the (internal) **state** of the system. It is a vector describing the system. \n",
    "   For example, one could describe the state, $x(t)$, of a car by its position, $p(t)$ and velocity, $\\dot p(t)$:    \n",
    "   $$x(t) = [p(t), \\dot p(t)]^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameters:**\n",
    "These are attributes/features that are specific to the problem, and will not change over time. For example, this could be the geometry of the car -- but varying across different cars, the values of these parameters may vary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the above aspects can be controlled while deriving a model, meaning we can choose what quantities will be captured in the model. Thus, to some extent we can choose the inputs to our system and the corresponding outputs to better suit our goal -- this notion will become clearer as we go through the examples in the lecture, this notebook, recitals and the problem sheet.\n"

    "In this model we included the drag force, roll resistance, thrust (engine model) and gravity as inputs to the system.   \n",

    "On the other hand one could make the model more complex and explicitly model the trust force by including brake losses, or a delay between applying the gas pedal and the vehicle accelerating.\n",
    "This would increase the scope of the system as new quantities such as temperatures and pressures inside the motor become relevant.\n",

    "Firstly, a system will often comprise a so-called **storage** quantity (e.g., energy, temperature, mass, momentum, etc...). In the case of a heating system of a house we could consider temperature of the house/room. Note that it is sometimes possible to consider multiple storage quantities for a given scenario, nevertheless sometimes it is easier to pick one option over another. Deciding which storage quantity is appropriate for a given context will mostly come through practice and experience. Nevertheless, we will limit the possible types to those mentioned below.\n",
