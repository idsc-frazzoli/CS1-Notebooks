    "This course has predominantly covered linear systems. However, most real-world systems are **nonlinear**. Until now, we have handled nonlinearities by **linearizing** around equilibrium points, and then since the behavior of the non-linear system near the equilibrium points can be similar to that of the linear, in such cases then design a controller for the linear system. Although this still requires testing and validation of the controller on the non-linear system, through the linear tools, one is able to understand some behaviors the non-linear system may exhibit. However, linear-systems do not capture all the behaviors that the non-linear may, such as **limit cycles**. \n",

    "Thus, this notebook introduces when a non-linear gain is present within a SISO single feedback system, how one can determine whether the system is (absolutely) stable, and whether limit cycles are present (and if present, whether they are stable)."

    "Below are some of the most common types of nonlinearities, along with real-life examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saturation**: When a system's output is limited to a maximum and/or minimum value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An electric motor driving wheels (e.g., of a car) has a \"functional\" range at which it can rotate the wheels. It is unable to rotate the wheels above a certain threshold without damaging the motor itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dead Zone**: A region where small inputs produce no output change.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A joystick in a game controller may have a small range around the neutral position where movement does not affect the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantization**: Continuous signals are mapped to discrete levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A digital thermometer rounds continuous temperature measurements to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hysteresis**: The output depends on the input's history (i.e., direction), not just its current value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A thermostat for home heating switches on below one temperature but only switches off after exceeding a higher temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relay (Switching Nonlinearity)**: The output switches between two distinct levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An on-off controller for a streetlight that turns on at dusk and off at dawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "These nonlinearities often arise in practical systems and can significantly affect system behavior, making them essential to understand for control design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, in general it is possible to classify nonlinear gains as *static* and *dynamic*. \n",

    "As previously mentioned, nonlinear systems may exhibit behaviors that are not captured with the systems and tools that have been introduced thus far. One of such behavior that is present when the nonlinear system is exposed to periodic excitation is called a **limit cycle**. Intuitively, suppose you apply a (temporary) sinusoidal input to a system with a nonlinear gain, and at one point you remove the input. Then the system will exhibit some periodic behavior. To determine whether limit cycles are present, this section introduces the corresponding approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Describing Function (DF) method approximates a nonlinear system as a linear one (i.e., is a form of quasi-linearization). When a sinusoidal signal $ u(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t) $ is applied to a nonlinear system, the output $ y(t) $ is generally periodic but with various harmonics. Instead of delving into the full complexity of the output, describing function analysis focuses on the **first harmonic**, $ b_1 \\sin(\\omega t) $, which often dominates in physical systems. This approximation is justified by the observation that many physical systems act as low-pass filters, attenuating higher-order harmonics and allowing the first harmonic to prevail. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this context, the describing function serves as an amplitude-dependent (approximate) transfer function that encapsulates the key characteristics of the nonlinearity. By approximating the nonlinear behavior in this manner, we can employ familiar tools like Nyquist plots to analyze the feedback system and predict the occurrence of limit cycles."
