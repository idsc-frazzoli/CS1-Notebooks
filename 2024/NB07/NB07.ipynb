    "Previously we have looked at how to determine the time response of a system. Building upon that, typically we wish for the system to approach some desired value (i.e., the reference). Consider that for the cruise control system of a vehicle, the vehicle should approach and remain at the preset value. However, depending on the type of system, it is not always the case that the time response will approach exactly the reference value; Instead resulting in an offset no matter how long you continue running the system for. This offset is known as the steady-state error, and is the difference between the systems' reference signal $r(t)$ and the closed-loop output $y(t)$ as $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty}$.\n",

    "Last week we saw that provided with an open-loop system, $L(s)$, how, using a feedback architecture, we can quickly analyze whether the closed-loop system design is feasible (e.g., stable) for some varying system parameter (e.g., the feedback gain) using the root locus. Although using this approach we could qualitatively infer whether there exists some value of $K$, such that the system is stable and/or that the time response would not oscillate/overshoot, in practice we wish to specify the *extent* to which a system can overshoot, or how *fast* the system should achieve its steady state value. In general, a system can have such specifications in the time-domain (i.e., on the time response) or in the frequency domain (we will start looking at the frequency domain starting next week). The below section is dedicated to describing the time-domain specifications for first, second and higher-order systems."

    "Above we have seen how to read the time-domain specifications directly off the time response. However, this is for the current system configuration -- i.e., given the transfer function of a system (open or closed-loop), we can read what the current time-domain specifications are. However, in many cases, we need to the design the system such that it achieves specified requirements. One way of doing this could be to parametrize the time response plots like above, and then determine suitable parameters for the system. However, since the time response of the systems is coupled to the poles of the systems, provided with the required time-domain specifications, it is possible to identify on the s-plane, the area in which the poles should be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general how the area of satisfaction looks on the s-plane will vary highly according to the problem at hand -- the following identities may come into use.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\omega_n &= \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Furthermore, in Problem Set 7 we have provided a couple questions that go through this process -- essentially reverse engineering the system parameters such that its poles are within the suitable area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is often useful to gain an intuitive understanding as to how the time specifications affect area of satisfaction on the s-plane. Let's consider the following time-domain specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Settling Time**: The settling time $T_d$ is directly linked to the real value of the poles. Recall $T_d = \\tau \\ln{\\frac{100}{d}}$, where $\\tau$ is determined off the real value of the poles. If $T_d$ must be smaller/greater than some value, then correspondingly, it is possible to identify the range of values for the poles. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Peak Overshoot Ratio**: Recall that the peak overshoot ratio $M_p$ is directly linked to the damping ratio. Furthermore, since $|\\varphi| = \\arcsin(\\zeta) = \\left|\\arctan{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega}}\\right|$, where $\\varphi$ is the angle between the pole and the zero axis, if provided with a desired maximum/minimum overshoot, it is possible to identity a range of locations in which the pole should lie such that the overshoot requirement is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rise Time**: Recall that the rise time is linked to the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ for the system. Since $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\omega^2}$, it is then possible to determine a range of values such that the poles lie in/out of the radius $\\omega_n$, if the rise time should be more\\less than some value."

Although in principle we can vary any parameter, tools such as MATLAB and Python, assume the standard feedback architecture we have previously seen -- i.e., provided with an open-loop transfer function $L(s)$, they compute the closed-loop poles of $T(s)= \\frac{KL(s)}{1+KL(s)}$. Thus, when using such tools to fine-tune controllers, it is important to keep in mind when plotting the root locus, which is the plotted gain. \n",

You then set fixed values of $T_I$ and $T_D$, and if there exists some $K_P$ that results in the closed-loop poles being in the ``good'' region of the s-plane, then you can calculate the corresponding $K_P, K_I, K_D$ for your controller.  \n",
    "2. Set $C(s) = K_P + \\frac{K_I}{s} + K_D s$. Then set $K_P, K_I$ and $K_D$ to some fixed values. Then plot the root locus for the closed-loop system $T(s)= \\frac{kL(s)}{1+kL(s)}$. Then, by looking at the root locus, for the values of $K$ for which the system satisfies your requirements, the values for the PID controller are multiplied by $K$.\n",
