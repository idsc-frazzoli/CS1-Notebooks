The next step is to be able to analyze and design system architectures such that the control objective is achieved. Since in general systems typically need to be closed-loop to achieve the control objective, below we briefly recount the notion of an open/closed-loop system, and the associated transfer function conventions that will be used through the remainder of the course.

These are explained in the lecture, and are provided in further detail at [https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Root_Locus/DeriveRootLocusRules.html](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Root_Locus/DeriveRootLocusRules.html), so we will not repeat the rules again. However, we provide below a generic (starting) methodology to help contextualize how to approach the drawing of a root locus:\n",

    "   2. End point: The poles when $K=\\infty$. \n",
    "      1. Note that $q=n-m$ poles converge to the open loop zeros. Excess closed-loop poles go to infinity. $n$ denotes the order of the denominator of $P(s)$, and $m$ denotes the order of the numerator of $P(s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rule 4: Draw the locus on the real axis (if it exists). \n",

    "3. Rule 5: Compute and Draw the intersection of the asymptote with the real axis (and the corresponding angles).\n",

    "\t- Asymptotes intersect the real axis at: $$\\sigma = \\frac{\\Sigma p_i - \\Sigma z_i}{q}$$\n",

    "4. Rule 6: Draw the Break-away/in points. \n",
    "\t- (We will not ask you to compute the break-away/in points during the exam, but if they are provided, you should be able to use them to complete the plot)\n",

If these are too great, feel free to reduce the maximum gain ``k_max`` and/or increase the ``k_interval`` parameters below -- Changing these parameters will solely change the visuals of the root locus, the plotted poles and time response remain unaffected.
