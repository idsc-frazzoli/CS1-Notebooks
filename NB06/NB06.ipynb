Consequentially, in this lecture we introduce feedback control, and then correspondingly design controllers such that the system achieves the control objective.\n",

    "# Open Loop vs Closed Loop Transfer Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In control systems engineering, one of the fundamental goals is to understand and manipulate how systems respond to inputs, ensuring that the control objective is achieved. As was introduced in Lecture 5, a key to this understanding lies in the use of transfer functions -- a mathematical description that map inputs to outputs in the frequency domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far the notion of transfer functions has been introduced. Given an LTI system in its state-space representation, we can transform it to a corresponding transfer function (Lecture 5), and given said transfer function, we know how its poles and zeros affect the output response to test inputs, and can graphically compute the magnitude and phase of the response (Lecture 6). In Lecture 7, the root locus method was introduced as a way of visualizing how the systems' closed-loop poles vary with a feedback gain. Before, introducing the root locus, below we briefly recount the notion of an open/closed-loop system, and the associated conventions that will be used through the remainder of the course. "

The signals may pass through solely a plant $P(s)$ (the system we are interested in controlling), or there may be a controller $C(s)$ that operates on a reference (input) $r$. The controller aims to help achieve the control objective, and for the time being consider it as pre-processing a reference to help the plant produce more desirable outputs.\n",

    "Consider the figure below, the controller $C(s)$ receives a reference input $R(s)$ and generates a control signal $u$. This control signal then drives our plant $P(s)$, producing the output $Y(s)$. Notice that at any point, the controller does not know what the output of the system is. \n",
