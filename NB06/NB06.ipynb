    "## Open Loop vs Closed Loop Transfer Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In control systems engineering, one of our fundamental goals is to understand and manipulate how systems respond to inputs. The key to this understanding lies in transfer functions - mathematical descriptions that map inputs to outputs in the frequency domain. Let's explore how different control architectures can dramatically change a system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Loop System\n",
    "The simplest control architecture we can implement is an open loop system. Think of it as giving instructions without checking the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/OL.png\" alt=\"Open Loop System\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this configuration, signals flow in only one direction. The controller C(s) receives our reference input R(s) and generates a control signal. This control signal then drives our plant P(s), producing the output Y(s). Notice how there's no way for the system to know what output it's actually producing - it simply processes the input and hopes for the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical relationship between input and output is straightforward in this case:\n",
    "$$T(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = L(s) = C(s)P(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While elegant in its simplicity, this architecture has a critical limitation: it can't compensate for disturbances or system changes. If something affects our plant's behavior, or if our initial model wasn't quite right, the output will deviate from what we want. The system has no way to detect or correct these errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closed Loop System\n",
    "To address these limitations, we can introduce one of the most powerful concepts in control theory: feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/CL.png\" alt=\"Closed Loop System\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference here is that the output Y(s) is fed back and compared with our reference input. This comparison generates an error signal that tells our controller how far we are from our desired output - a crucial piece of information that was missing in our open loop system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical description becomes more intricate, but this complexity brings significant benefits. Let's derive the transfer function step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Y(s) &= P(s)U(s) \\\\\n",
    "U(s) &= C(s)E(s) \\\\\n",
    "E(s) &= R(s) - Y(s) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "By substituting these relationships, we can find how the system responds to inputs:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "E(s) &= R(s) - P(s)U(s) \\\\\n",
    "E(s) &= R(s) - L(s)E(s) \\\\\n",
    "E(s) &= \\frac{R(s)}{1 + L(s)}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to our closed-loop transfer function:\n",
    "$$T(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \\frac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This feedback path fundamentally changes the system's behavior. Now we have control over the system's poles, allowing us to shape its response. When disturbances occur or when the plant's behavior changes, the system detects these deviations and automatically compensates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedback Control System Behavior: A Deeper Look\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these theoretical concepts is crucial, but their real power becomes apparent when we apply them to practical problems. Let's examine how feedback control can transform an inherently unstable system into a stable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stabilizing the Unstable: The Inverted Pendulum \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider one of the classic problems in control theory: the inverted pendulum. This system naturally wants to fall, making it inherently unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./img/pendulum.png\" alt=\"Inverted Pendulum\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pendulum has the following parameters:\n",
    "- Length: L = $\\frac{3}{2}$\n",
    "- Mass: m = $1$\n",
    "- Moment of inertia: J = $\\frac{1}{3}mL^2$ = $\\frac{3}{4}$\n",
    "- Damping coefficient: c = $\\frac{9}{4}$\n",
    "- Input torque: $\\tau_f$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we linearize around the upright position, we get this transfer function:\n",
    "$$P(s) = \\frac{3}{s^2 + 3s - 10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic equation reveals our system's natural behavior:\n",
    "$$s^2 + 3s - 10 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With poles at:\n",
    "$$\\lambda_1 = 2, \\quad \\lambda_2 = -5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive pole ($\\lambda_1 = 2$) confirms what we intuitively know - the upright position is unstable. Any slight disturbance will cause the pendulum to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where feedback control shows its power. By adding a simple proportional controller:\n",
    "$$C(s) = K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We transform the system's behavior. The closed-loop transfer function becomes:\n",
    "$$T(s) = \\frac{3K}{s^2 + 3s - 10 + 3K}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With characteristic equation:\n",
    "$$s^2 + 3s - 10 + 3K = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And poles:\n",
    "$$\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 + 4(10 - 3K)}}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis shows that stability is achieved when:\n",
    "$$K > \\frac{10}{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the system's behavior and the effect of feedback control, let's explore an interactive visualization. Below, you'll find a dynamic analysis tool that shows both the system's time response and pole locations for different configurations.\n"
