    "\n",
    "In control systems engineering, one of the fundamental goals is to understand and manipulate how systems respond to inputs, such that the control objective is achieved. As was introduced in Lecture 5, transfer functions are a useful representation to help us analyze and design systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, given an LTI system in its state-space representation, we can transform it to a corresponding transfer function (Lecture 5), and given said transfer function, we know how its poles and zeros affect the output response, and can graphically compute the magnitude and phase of the response (Lecture 6). The next step is to be able to analyze and design systems such that the control objective is achieved. However, before allocating a large amount of time determining a suitable controller and tuning the systems parameters, it would be useful to determine whether the current system design is feasible (i.e., there exist some controller parameters that ensure the objective is achieved). A quick method of assessing design feasibility of a system, is by using the Root Locus Method -- a graphical approach that illustrates how the closed-loop poles of a system vary with a feedback gain. \n",

    "To help plot the root locus, there are some rules to follow. These are explained in the lecture, and are provided in further detail at [https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Root_Locus/DeriveRootLocusRules.html](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Root_Locus/DeriveRootLocusRules.html), so we will not repeat the rules again. However, we provide below a generic (starting) methodology to help contextualize how to approach the drawing of a root locus:\n",

    "      1. Note that $q=n-m$ poles converge to the open loop zeros. Excess closed-loop poles go to infinity. $n$ denotes the order of the denominator of $L(s)$, and $m$ denotes the order of the numerator of $L(s)$.\n",

    "2. Rule 4: Draw the locus on the real axis (if it exists). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rule 5: Compute and Draw the intersection of the asymptote with the real axis (and the corresponding angles).\n",
    "\t- This is present if the number of poles is greater than the number of zeros - i.e., $q>0$. \n",

    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$$\\angle s = \\frac{\\pm q \\cdot 360^\\circ}{\\# poles - \\# zeros} \\text{ if } k<0$$\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith $q = 1, \\ldots, (\\# poles - \\# zeros)$\n",
