    "Previously we have discussed how to express the input-output behaviour of a system. However, as seen in Lecture 1, the system behaviour may be undesired (i.e., unstable). Consequentially, in this lecture we introduce feedback control, where the aim is to be able to analyze a system behaviour, and then correspondingly design controllers such that the system behaviour achieved some specified objective.\n",

By measuring the system's output and comparing it to a desired reference, a controller can adjust the system's input to achieve the desired output.
