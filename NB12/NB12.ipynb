    "This course has predominantly covered linear systems. However, most real-world systems are **nonlinear**. Until now, we have handled nonlinearities by **linearizing** around equilibrium points, and then since the behavior of the non-linear system near the equilibrium points can be similar to that of the linear, in such cases then design a controller for the linear system. Although this still requires testing and validation of the controller on the non-linear system, through the linear tools, one is able to understand some behaviors the non-linear system may exhibit. However, linear-systems do not capture all the behaviors that the non-linear may, such as **limit cycles**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we briefly introduce, when a non-linear gain is present within a SISO single feedback system, how we can determine whether the system is stable, and whether limit cycles are present (and if present, whether they are stable)."

    "Below are some of the most common types of nonlinearities, along with real-life examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saturation**: When a system's output is limited to a maximum and/or minimum value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An electric motor driving wheels (e.g., of a car) has a \"functional\" range at which it can rotate the wheels. It is unable to rotate the wheels above a certain threshold without damaging the motor itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dead Zone**: A region where small inputs produce no output change.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A joystick in a game controller may have a small range around the neutral position where movement does not affect the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantization**: Continuous signals are mapped to discrete levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A digital thermometer rounds continuous temperature measurements to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hysteresis**: The output depends on the input's history (i.e., direction), not just its current value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A thermostat for home heating switches on below one temperature but only switches off after exceeding a higher temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relay (Switching Nonlinearity)**: The output switches between two distinct levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An on-off controller for a streetlight that turns on at dusk and off at dawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "These nonlinearities often arise in practical systems and can significantly affect system behavior, making them essential to understand for control design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, in general it is possible to classify nonlinear gains as *static* and *dynamic*. \n",

Real-world systems often exhibit nonlinearities such as saturation, dead zones, and hysteresis, which can lead to behaviors like limit cycles—persistent oscillations that occur even in the absence of external inputs. To effectively study these systems, we need methods that can approximate their behavior while still utilizing the robust tools of linear control theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Describing Function (DF)** method provides a practical solution by simplifying the nonlinear element in a feedback system into an equivalent amplitude-dependent transfer function. This approach allows us to analyze the system using familiar linear techniques while preserving essential characteristics of the nonlinear behavior. Describing function analysis primarily aims to determine whether a nonlinear system will exhibit limit cycles, and if so, to identify their amplitude and frequency. By offering approximate yet insightful predictions, this method serves as a valuable tool for understanding and designing nonlinear feedback systems.\n"

    "In numerous engineering applications, a nonlinear element is present within a feedback loop that includes a linear system. While the stability of the linear component can often be assessed using standard methods, the inclusion of a nonlinearity complicates the overall analysis. For example, when a linear Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system interacts with a nonlinear element like saturation or hysteresis, it may result in oscillations or other dynamic behaviors that linear theory alone cannot explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The describing function approach tackles this issue by approximating the nonlinear element as a transfer function that depends on the amplitude of the input signal. This simplification enables the analysis of the stability of the entire feedback system, including the nonlinear component. The primary objectives of this analysis are to determine whether limit cycles exist within the system, to identify the number of such cycles, and to ascertain their respective amplitudes and frequencies. By concentrating on these critical aspects, describing function analysis offers a manageable way to study nonlinear feedback systems while maintaining a connection to the linear control framework.\n"

    "As previously mentioned, nonlinear systems may exhibit behaviors that are not captured with the systems and tools that have been introduced thus far. One of such behavior that is present when the nonlinear system is exposed to periodic excitation is called a **limit cycle**. Intuitively, suppose you apply a (temporary) sinusoidal input to a system with a nonlinear gain, and at one point you remove the input. Then the system will exhibit some periodic behavior $^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Describing Function (DF) method approximates a nonlinear system as a linear one (i.e., is a form of quasi-linearization). When a sinusoidal signal $ u(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t) $ is applied to a nonlinear system, the output $ y(t) $ is generally periodic but with various harmonics. Instead of delving into the full complexity of the output, describing function analysis focuses on the **first harmonic**, $ b_1 \\sin(\\omega t) $, which often dominates in practical scenarios. This approximation is justified by the observation that many physical systems act as low-pass filters, attenuating higher-order harmonics and allowing the first harmonic to prevail. \n",

    "> N(A) = \\frac{b_1}{A}.\n",
    "> $$\n",

    "In this context, the describing function serves as an amplitude-dependent transfer function that encapsulates the key characteristics of the nonlinearity. By approximating the nonlinear behavior in this manner, we can employ familiar tools like Nyquist plots to analyze the feedback system and predict the occurrence of limit cycles.\n",

    "$^*$: Limit cycles and how to identify will be introduced later on (as they rely on using the describing function), but keep in mind that the following method is inspired by some behavior."

    "One of the most significant applications of describing functions is in analyzing the existence and characteristics of limit cycles in nonlinear feedback systems. A limit cycle is a self-sustaining oscillation that arises when the feedback loop stabilizes at a specific amplitude and frequency. Describing function analysis predicts limit cycles by identifying intersections between the Nyquist plot of the linear system \\( L(j\\omega) \\) and the curve \\( -1/N(A) \\) representing the nonlinear element.\n",

    "If such intersections are found, they indicate the amplitude \\( A \\) and frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the potential limit cycle.

This analysis is crucial for ensuring that the system behaves as intended and for designing controllers that can mitigate unwanted oscillations.\n",
