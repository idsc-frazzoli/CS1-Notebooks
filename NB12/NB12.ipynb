    "This course has predominantly covered linear systems. However, most real-world systems are **nonlinear**. Until now, we have handled nonlinearities by **linearizing** around equilibrium points, and then since the behavior of the non-linear system near the equilibrium points can be similar to that of the linear, in such cases then design a controller for the linear system. Although this still requires testing and validation of the controller on the non-linear system, through the linear tools, one is able to understand some behaviors the non-linear system may exhibit. However, linear-systems do not capture all the behaviors that the non-linear may, such as **limit cycles**. \n",

    "## Common Nonlinearities\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear elements are present in many real-world control systems. Below are some of the most common types of nonlinearities, along with real-life examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saturation**: When a system's output is limited to a maximum or minimum value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: The throttle of a car can only open between 0% and 100%, regardless of the driver's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dead Zone**: A region where small inputs produce no output change.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A joystick in a game controller may have a small range around the neutral position where movement does not affect the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantization**: Continuous signals are mapped to discrete levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A digital thermometer rounds continuous temperature measurements to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hysteresis**: The output depends on the input's history, not just its current value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A thermostat for home heating switches on below one temperature but only switches off after exceeding a higher temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relay (Switching Nonlinearity)**: The output switches between two distinct levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An on-off controller for a streetlight that turns on at dusk and off at dawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "These nonlinearities often arise in practical systems and can significantly affect system behavior, making them essential to understand for control design.\n"

    "\n",
    "Nonlinear systems present significant challenges in control theory, as traditional tools like Nyquist and Bode plots are tailored for linear systems and cannot directly address the intricacies of nonlinear dynamics. Real-world systems often exhibit nonlinearities such as saturation, dead zones, and hysteresis, which can lead to behaviors like limit cycles—persistent oscillations that occur even in the absence of external inputs. To effectively study these systems, we need methods that can approximate their behavior while still utilizing the robust tools of linear control theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Describing Function (DF)** method provides a practical solution by simplifying the nonlinear element in a feedback system into an equivalent amplitude-dependent transfer function. This approach allows us to analyze the system using familiar linear techniques while preserving essential characteristics of the nonlinear behavior. Describing function analysis primarily aims to determine whether a nonlinear system will exhibit limit cycles, and if so, to identify their amplitude and frequency. By offering approximate yet insightful predictions, this method serves as a valuable tool for understanding and designing nonlinear feedback systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation: Why Describing Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "In numerous engineering applications, a nonlinear element is present within a feedback loop that includes a linear system. While the stability of the linear component can often be assessed using standard methods, the inclusion of a nonlinearity complicates the overall analysis. For example, when a linear Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system interacts with a nonlinear element like saturation or hysteresis, it may result in oscillations or other dynamic behaviors that linear theory alone cannot explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The describing function approach tackles this issue by approximating the nonlinear element as a transfer function that depends on the amplitude of the input signal. This simplification enables the analysis of the stability of the entire feedback system, including the nonlinear component. The primary objectives of this analysis are to determine whether limit cycles exist within the system, to identify the number of such cycles, and to ascertain their respective amplitudes and frequencies. By concentrating on these critical aspects, describing function analysis offers a manageable way to study nonlinear feedback systems while maintaining a connection to the linear control framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Idea Behind Describing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The describing function method is based on the concept that a nonlinear system can be approximated by examining its response to sinusoidal inputs. When a sinusoidal signal \\( u(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t) \\) is applied to a nonlinear system, the output \\( y(t) \\) is generally periodic but typically contains harmonics of the input frequency. Instead of delving into the full complexity of the output, describing function analysis focuses on the **first harmonic**, \\( b_1 \\sin(\\omega t) \\), which often dominates in practical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approximation is justified by the observation that many physical systems act as low-pass filters, attenuating higher-order harmonics and allowing the first harmonic to prevail. The describing function is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the first harmonic (\\( b_1 \\)) to the input amplitude (\\( A \\)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(A) = \\frac{b_1}{A}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the describing function serves as an amplitude-dependent transfer function that encapsulates the key characteristics of the nonlinearity. By approximating the nonlinear behavior in this manner, we can employ familiar tools like Nyquist plots to analyze the feedback system and predict the occurrence of limit cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Describing Function as an Approximate Transfer Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To grasp how describing functions operate, consider a nonlinear system whose output \\( y(t) \\) can be expressed as a Fourier series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t) = b_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + b_2 \\sin(2\\omega t) + \\dots.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \\( b_1 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) represents the first harmonic of the output, while the higher-order terms correspond to additional harmonics generated by the nonlinearity. Describing function analysis concentrates on the first harmonic, approximating the output as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t) \\approx b_1 \\sin(\\omega t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient \\( b_1 \\) is determined using the Fourier formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} y(t) \\sin(\\omega t) \\, d(\\omega t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the describing function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(A) = \\frac{1}{\\pi A} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} y(t) \\sin(\\omega t) \\, d(\\omega t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression illustrates how the nonlinearity transforms the input amplitude \\( A \\) into the amplitude and phase of the output's first harmonic. By treating the nonlinear element as an approximate transfer function, the describing function enables the analysis of nonlinear feedback systems using linear control tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deriving the Describing Function for Saturation Nonlinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the derivation of describing functions, let’s examine the case of a **saturation nonlinearity**, a common phenomenon in systems with physical limits. Saturation occurs when the system's output is constrained to a maximum value \\( \\pm M \\), regardless of the input amplitude. This type of nonlinearity is frequently encountered in actuators and systems with restricted operational ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an input signal \\( u(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t) \\), the output \\( y(t) \\) of a saturation nonlinearity is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "M, & u(t) \\geq M, \\\\\n",
    "-M, & u(t) \\leq -M, \\\\\n",
    "u(t), & -M < u(t) < M.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The describing function focuses on the first harmonic of the output, \\( b_1 \\sin(\\omega t) \\). Using the Fourier formula, \\( b_1 \\) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b_1 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\arcsin(M/A)} M \\sin(\\omega t) \\, d(\\omega t) + \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{\\arcsin(M/A)}^{\\pi} A \\sin(\\omega t) \\, d(\\omega t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating the integrals, the describing function \\( N(A) \\) for the saturation nonlinearity is obtained as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(A) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left[ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{M}{A}\\right) + \\frac{M}{A} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{M}{A}\\right)^2} \\right], & A > M, \\\\\n",
    "1, & A \\leq M.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result illustrates how the describing function varies with the input amplitude \\( A \\). For small amplitudes (\\( A \\leq M \\)), the system behaves linearly with a gain of 1. For larger amplitudes (\\( A > M \\)), the gain diminishes due to the saturation effect, reflecting the nonlinear behavior of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Describing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most significant applications of describing functions is in analyzing the existence and characteristics of limit cycles in nonlinear feedback systems. A limit cycle is a self-sustaining oscillation that arises when the feedback loop stabilizes at a specific amplitude and frequency. Describing function analysis predicts limit cycles by identifying intersections between the Nyquist plot of the linear system \\( L(j\\omega) \\) and the curve \\( -1/N(A) \\) representing the nonlinear element.\n",
    "\n",
    "If such intersections are found, they indicate the amplitude \\( A \\) and frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the potential limit cycle. Furthermore, the stability of the limit cycle can be evaluated by examining how variations in amplitude influence the system's response. This analysis is crucial for ensuring that the system behaves as intended and for designing controllers that can mitigate unwanted oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to predicting limit cycles, describing function analysis can be employed in the design and tuning of nonlinear controllers, ensuring robust performance despite the presence of nonlinearities. By providing a bridge between linear and nonlinear control theories, describing functions facilitate the development of effective control strategies for complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Limit Cycle Prediction Using Describing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a feedback system where a linear controller \\( L(j\\omega) \\) is in series with a saturation nonlinearity. To predict the existence of a limit cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine the Describing Function \\( N(A) \\)** for the saturation nonlinearity as derived earlier.\n",
    "2. **Plot the Nyquist Diagram** of the linear system \\( L(j\\omega) \\).\n",
    "3. **Identify Intersection Points** between the Nyquist plot and the curve \\( -1/N(A) \\).\n",
    "4. **Extract Amplitude and Frequency**: The intersection points provide the amplitude \\( A \\) and frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the potential limit cycles.\n",
    "5. **Assess Stability**: Analyze the slope of \\( N(A) \\) at the intersection points to determine the stability of the predicted limit cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step-by-step approach illustrates how Describing Function Analysis can be practically applied to predict and evaluate limit cycles in nonlinear feedback systems.\n"
