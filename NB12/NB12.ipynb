    "This course has predominantly covered linear systems. However, most real-world systems are **nonlinear**. Until now, we have handled nonlinearities by **linearizing** around equilibrium points, and then since the behavior of the non-linear system near the equilibrium points can be similar to that of the linear, in such cases then design a controller for the linear system. Although this still requires testing and validation of the controller on the non-linear system, through the linear tools, one is able to understand some behaviors the non-linear system may exhibit. However, linear-systems do not capture all the behaviors that the non-linear may, such as **limit cycles**. \n",

    "Below are some of the most common types of nonlinearities, along with real-life examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saturation**: When a system's output is limited to a maximum and/or minimum value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An electric motor driving wheels (e.g., of a car) has a \"functional\" range at which it can rotate the wheels. It is unable to rotate the wheels above a certain threshold without damaging the motor itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dead Zone**: A region where small inputs produce no output change.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A joystick in a game controller may have a small range around the neutral position where movement does not affect the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantization**: Continuous signals are mapped to discrete levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A digital thermometer rounds continuous temperature measurements to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hysteresis**: The output depends on the input's history (i.e., direction), not just its current value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A thermostat for home heating switches on below one temperature but only switches off after exceeding a higher temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relay (Switching Nonlinearity)**: The output switches between two distinct levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An on-off controller for a streetlight that turns on at dusk and off at dawn.\n",

    "# Absolute Stability Analysis for Static Nonlinearities\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we examine describing functions, we need to understand how to analyze the stability of systems with static nonlinearities. This analysis method is particularly useful when we cannot determine stability using just linear analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Absolute Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "A feedback system containing:\n",
    "- 1. A linear plant $G(s)$,\n",
    "- 2. A static nonlinear \"gain\" element $\\textit{NL}$: $u \\rightarrow y(u)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonlinearity is characterized by:\n",
    "- $y(0) = 0$ (the nonlinearity is centered at the origin),\n",
    "- $k_1 \\leq \\frac{y(u)}{u} \\leq k_2$ for all $u \\neq 0$ (the nonlinearity is bounded).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in other words, the nonlinearity function's graph must be contained within a sector bounded by lines of slope $k_1$ and $k_2$: $k_1 u \\leq \\textit{NL}(u) \\leq k_2 u$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Absolute Stability Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of absolute stability is used to determine whether a feedback system with a static nonlinearity is stable. The system is considered absolutely stable if for the nonlinearity $\\textit{NL}$ as described above, $u=0$ is a global asymptotically stable equilibrium point for the closed loop system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sector contains all linear gains between $k_1$ and $k_2$, a necessary condition for absolute stability is that the Nyquist plot encircles the segment [$\\frac{-1}{k_1}, \\frac{-1}{k_2}$] counterclockwise a number of times equal to the number of unstable poles of $L(s)$.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sufficient Condition (Circle Criterion)\n",
    "\n",
    "A sufficient condition for absolute stability is that the Nyquist plot of $L(s)$ encircles the circle with diameter $[\\frac{-1}{k_1}, \\frac{-1}{k_2}]$ counterclockwise a number of times equal to the number of unstable poles of $L(s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extension of the Nyquist stability criterion where:\n",
    "- Instead of counting encirclements of the $-\\frac{1}{k}$ point\n",
    "- We count encirclements of a circle with diameter $[\\frac{-1}{k_1}, \\frac{-1}{k_2}]$\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When We Cannot Conclude About Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several situations where absolute stability analysis becomes inconclusive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Necessary but not Sufficient**\n",
    "   - When the necessary condition is met but the sufficient condition isn't\n",
    "   - The system might still be stable, but we cannot guarantee it\n",
    "   - Additional analysis techniques (like describing functions) may be needed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Describing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding of absolute stability forms a foundation for more advanced analysis techniques like describing functions, which we'll explore next. While absolute stability gives us guarantee of stability for certain classes of nonlinearities, describing functions will help us analyze specific behaviors like limit cycles."

Real-world systems often exhibit nonlinearities such as saturation, dead zones, and hysteresis, which can lead to behaviors like limit cyclesâpersistent oscillations that occur even in the absence of external inputs. To effectively study these systems, we need methods that can approximate their behavior while still utilizing the robust tools of linear control theory.\n",

While the stability of the linear component can often be assessed using standard methods, the inclusion of a nonlinearity complicates the overall analysis. For example, when a linear Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system interacts with a nonlinear element like saturation or hysteresis, it may result in oscillations or other dynamic behaviors that linear theory alone cannot explain.\n",

    "As previously mentioned, nonlinear systems may exhibit behaviors that are not captured with the systems and tools that have been introduced thus far. One of such behavior that is present when the nonlinear system is exposed to periodic excitation is called a **limit cycle**. Intuitively, suppose you apply a (temporary) sinusoidal input to a system with a nonlinear gain, and at one point you remove the input. Then the system will exhibit some periodic behavior $^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Describing Function (DF) method approximates a nonlinear system as a linear one (i.e., is a form of quasi-linearization). When a sinusoidal signal $ u(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t) $ is applied to a nonlinear system, the output $ y(t) $ is generally periodic but with various harmonics. Instead of delving into the full complexity of the output, describing function analysis focuses on the **first harmonic**, $ b_1 \\sin(\\omega t) $, which often dominates in practical scenarios. This approximation is justified by the observation that many physical systems act as low-pass filters, attenuating higher-order harmonics and allowing the first harmonic to prevail. \n",

    "In this context, the describing function serves as an amplitude-dependent transfer function that encapsulates the key characteristics of the nonlinearity. By approximating the nonlinear behavior in this manner, we can employ familiar tools like Nyquist plots to analyze the feedback system and predict the occurrence of limit cycles.\n",

A limit cycle is a self-sustaining oscillation that arises when the feedback loop stabilizes at a specific amplitude and frequency. Describing function analysis predicts limit cycles by identifying intersections between the Nyquist plot of the linear system \\( L(j\\omega) \\) and the curve \\( -1/N(A) \\) representing the nonlinear element.\n",

    "If such intersections are found, they indicate the amplitude \\( A \\) and frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the potential limit cycle.

This analysis is crucial for ensuring that the system behaves as intended and for designing controllers that can mitigate unwanted oscillations.\n",
