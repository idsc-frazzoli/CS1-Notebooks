    "Most real-world systems are **nonlinear**, meaning they do not follow the principle of superposition. Until now, we have handled nonlinearities by **linearizing** around equilibrium points, but this approach fails to capture important global behaviors like **limit cycles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we introduce the concept of **describing functions**, which approximate nonlinear elements as **amplitude-dependent gains**. This method allows us to predict the existence of **limit cycles**, analyze their stability, and check for **absolute stability** in feedback systems. By the end of this lecture, you will be able to apply describing functions to analyze and understand nonlinear control systems."

    "## Common Nonlinearities\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear elements are present in many real-world control systems. Below are some of the most common types of nonlinearities, along with real-life examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saturation**: When a system's output is limited to a maximum or minimum value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: The throttle of a car can only open between 0% and 100%, regardless of the driver's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dead Zone**: A region where small inputs produce no output change.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A joystick in a game controller may have a small range around the neutral position where movement does not affect the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantization**: Continuous signals are mapped to discrete levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A digital thermometer rounds continuous temperature measurements to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hysteresis**: The output depends on the input's history, not just its current value.\n",
    "   - **Example**: A thermostat for home heating switches on below one temperature but only switches off after exceeding a higher temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relay (Switching Nonlinearity)**: The output switches between two distinct levels.\n",
    "   - **Example**: An on-off controller for a streetlight that turns on at dusk and off at dawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "These nonlinearities often arise in practical systems and can significantly affect system behavior, making them essential to understand for control design.\n"
