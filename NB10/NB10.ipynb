    "In the past few weeks we have introduced the frequency response, and corresponding tools (Bode, Nyquist) that we can use to assess both closed-loop stability, stability margins and system behavior. However, we had not yet seen how we could use the frequency responses to determine whether the desired behavior is achieved. Thus, this week we introduce frequency-domain specifications, the frequency equivalent of the time-domain specifications seen previously, along with how they can be used to achieve the desired system behavior."

    "So far we have considered (time) specifications in terms of output responses -- e.g., ensure that the system achieves $M\\%$ overshoot with a rise time of $X$ seconds with no steady state error. However, control systems are typically exposed to disturbances and noise, which may correspondingly affect the ability to achieve such specifications. As an intuitive example, consider that we wish to regulate the temperature of a room. If the noise of the temperature sensor is large, it could result in the thermostat continuously adjusting the temperature of the room, and thus the room temperature may never reach its desired temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disturbance and noise signals can be typically expressed in terms of some frequency band -- e.g., think that the noise from a sensor typically occurs at a high-frequency (greater than $100Hz$), whereas disturbances, such as the draft entering from below a door, typically occur at low frequencies (less than $10Hz$). Consequentially, we can express disturbance rejection and noise rejection by through distinct frequency bands:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Command tracking/disturbance rejection:\n",
    "   - $|S(j\\omega)| \\ll 1$ at low frequencies, \n",

    "\n",
    "The above specifications can be quite generic in general and mixed and matched with time-domain specification as well as the phase and gain margins -- e.g., have a rise time of $X$ seconds whilst maintaining a phase margin of $Y^\\circ$. Although for certain specifications it may be possible to derive expressions for specific systems (i.e., with what we did for time-domain specifications of $1^{\\text{st}}$ and $2^{\\text{nd}}$ order systems), approximations are typically performed as a rule of thumb as they tend to hold, and the results can then be easily verified. Consequentially, if non-standard approximations are required, these will be provided in the question -- see the problems in the corresponding problem sheet for examples on this.\n",

    "Consider for example a system with a non-minimum phase zero (a zero in the right half-plane). We can always factor such a system as P(s) = Pmp(s) · D(s), where Pmp(s) is a nicely behaved minimum-phase system and D(s) is what we might call a \"Bode demon\" - an all-pass filter that doesn't affect the magnitude but introduces an unavoidable phase lag. Specifically, it adds a phase lag of -2arctan(ω/z), reducing our achievable phase margin. The practical consequence? We're forced to cross 0dB at lower frequencies, effectively slowing down our closed-loop system. The slower the zero (small z), the worse this limitation becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar story unfolds for unstable open-loop systems (those with poles in the right half-plane), but with a twist. Here the \"Bode demon\" adds a phase lag of -2arctan(p/ω). To stabilize such a system, we must cross 0dB at higher frequencies, requiring high bandwidth and gain. This translates to needing fast controllers and powerful actuators in practice. And just as slow non-minimum phase zeros are troublesome, fast unstable poles (large p) pose greater challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't just practical difficulties - they represent fundamental limitations in control design, beautifully captured in Bode's integral theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\log|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega = \\pi\\sum p_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This elegant formula tells us something profound: if we want to reject disturbances in one frequency range (small sensitivity S), we must necessarily amplify them somewhere else. It's a mathematical expression of the \"waterbed effect\" - push down one part of the sensitivity function, and another part must rise. The presence of unstable poles makes this tradeoff even more severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes control design both challenging and fascinating. There's rarely a \"perfect\" solution - instead, we must carefully balance tradeoffs based on what matters most for our specific application. The interactive tool above lets you explore these tradeoffs in a simplified setting, but keeping these fundamental limitations in mind helps us set realistic expectations and make informed design choices in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize this waterbed effect directly. In the plot below, we have a simple feedback system with a PI controller. Try increasing the controller gain - as you make the sensitivity smaller at low frequencies (better disturbance rejection), watch how it inevitably increases at higher frequencies (worse noise rejection). This is the waterbed effect in action, and it's a fundamental limitation that no clever control design can circumvent!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the total area between the sensitivity curve and the 0dB line remains roughly constant - this is exactly what Bode's integral theorem tells us. When we have unstable poles, this area must become even larger, making our design tradeoffs even more challenging."
