    "In the past few weeks we have introduced the frequency response, and corresponding tools (Bode, Nyquist) to assess closed-loop stability, stability margins and general system (frequency-conditioned) behavior. However, we had not yet seen how to (systematically) use the frequency response to achieve the control objective. Thus, this week we introduce frequency-domain specifications, the frequency equivalent of the time-domain specifications seen previously, along with how we can systematically design dynamic compensators -- through loop shaping --, to achieve the control objective."

    "So far we have considered (time) specifications in terms of output responses -- e.g., ensure that the system achieves $M\\%$ overshoot with a rise time of $X$ seconds with no steady state error. However, control systems are typically exposed to disturbances and noise, which may correspondingly affect the ability to achieve such specifications. As an intuitive example, consider that we wish to regulate the temperature of a room. Suppose a dynamic compensator has been tuned such that it satisfies the time-domain specifications. However, if the temperature sensor exhibits a noisy temperature signal, it could result in the thermostat accounting for effects that are not present -- i.e., it does not need to change the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disturbance and noise signals can be typically expressed in terms of some frequency band -- e.g., think that the noise from a sensor typically occurs at a high-frequency (greater than $100Hz$), whereas disturbances, such as the draft entering from below a door, typically occur at low frequencies (less than $10Hz$). Consequentially, we can express disturbance rejection and noise rejection by through distinct frequency bands:\n",

    "- *High frequencies*: At high frequencies, investigate noise rejection.\n",

    "Frequency specifications are typically phrased in terms of achieving, good command tracking/disturbance rejection and noise rejection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Command tracking/disturbance rejection:\n",
    "   - $|S(j\\omega)| \\ll 1$ at low frequencies, \n",
    "   - Thus $|L(j\\omega)|$ is large at low frequencies and hence $|T(j\\omega)|\\approx 1$ at low frequencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Noise rejection:\n",

    "   - Example: *ensure noise is reduced by factor of 10 at frequencies above 100Hz*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the closed-loop specifications are connected to the open-loop, given a certain specification -- *ensure $|L(s)|<a, \\forall \\omega < b Hz$ * --, it is possible to plot the corresponding \"good region\" in the open-loop bode plot. This, is introduced in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is important to note that the above specifications can be quite generic in general and mixed and matched with time-domain specification as well as the phase and gain margins -- e.g., have a rise time of $X$ seconds whilst maintaining a phase margin of $Y^\\circ$. Although for certain specifications it may be possible to derive expressions for specific systems (i.e., with what we did for time-domain specifications of $1^{\\text{st}}$ and $2^{\\text{nd}}$ order systems), approximations can be performed as they tend to hold (under certain assumptions), and the results can then be easily verified. Consequentially, if non-standard approximations are required, these will be provided in the question -- see the problems in the corresponding problem sheet for examples on this."

    "Recall the time-domain specifications and how we used the root locus to tune controllers such that the specifications were met. Although, certain approaches were introduced, they mostly are based on trial and error -- e.g., pick some $k_p$, draw root locus, if locus does not go through the \"good\" region, add $k_d$, and try again. Further, since the \"good\" region is derived directly from the output response, as one changes the dynamic compensator, the \"good\" region varies. Frequency specifications provide us with tools for a more systematic approach to control synthesis -- i.e., to \"steer\" us through the Bode obstacle course. \n",

    "Previously, we have stated that, when relying on the Bode plot, in the case that the open-loop system has poles or zeros in the right-half plane, that all results should be checked (either with the Nyquist and/or root locus). Similarly, when performing loop shaping on an open-loop system with such poles/zeros, the same goes. However, it is possible to use the same loop shaping principles to tune a dynamic compensator if open-loop zeros/poles are present in the right-half plane -- but again, always double-check the results.\n",

The practical consequence? We're forced to cross 0dB at lower frequencies, effectively slowing down our closed-loop system. The slower the zero (small z), the worse this limitation becomes."

To stabilize such a system, we must cross 0dB at higher frequencies, requiring high bandwidth and gain. This translates to needing fast controllers and powerful actuators in practice.

The presence of unstable poles makes this trade-off more severe.\n",

    "This is what makes control design both challenging and fascinating. There's rarely a \"perfect\" solution - instead, we must carefully balance tradeoffs based on what matters most for our specific application.

    "Let's visualize this waterbed effect directly. In the plot below, we have a simple feedback system with a PI controller. Try increasing the controller gain - as you make the sensitivity smaller at low frequencies (better disturbance rejection), watch how it inevitably increases at higher frequencies (worse noise rejection). This is the waterbed effect in action, and it's a fundamental limitation that no clever control design can circumvent!\n",
