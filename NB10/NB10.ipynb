    "## 1. Frequency-Domain Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency-domain specifications provide a powerful way to express control requirements. The key idea is to separate different control objectives by frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low frequencies: Command tracking and disturbance rejection\n",
    "- High frequencies: Noise rejection \n",
    "- Mid frequencies: Stability margins and robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "For a closed-loop system, we work with two key transfer functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sensitivity function: $S(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + L(s)}$\n",
    "   - $S(s)$ captures the system's ability to reject disturbances and determines error in tracking commands\n",
    "2. Complementary sensitivity function: $T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)}$\n",
    "   - $T(s)$ captures the system's ability to track commands and determines the effect of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L(s) = P(s)C(s)$ is the loop transfer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key specifications are typically written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Command tracking/disturbance rejection:\n",
    "   - $|S(j\\omega)| \\ll 1$ at low frequencies\n",
    "   - Example: \"ensure commands are tracked with max 10% error up to 10Hz\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Noise rejection:\n",
    "   - $|T(j\\omega)| \\ll 1$ at high frequencies  \n",
    "   - Example: \"ensure noise is reduced by factor of 10 at frequencies above 100Hz\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Translating to Open-Loop Specifications\n",
    "The closed-loop specifications can be translated to requirements on the open-loop transfer function $L(s)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Command tracking/disturbance rejection requirement:\n",
    "   - $|S(j\\omega)| \\cdot |W_1(j\\omega)| < 1$ \n",
    "   - This translates to $|L(j\\omega)| > |W_1(j\\omega)|$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Noise rejection requirement:\n",
    "   - $|T(j\\omega)| \\cdot |W_2(j\\omega)| < 1$\n",
    "   - This translates to $|L(j\\omega)| < |W_2(j\\omega)|^{-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross-over frequency:\n",
    "   - The frequency where $|L(j\\omega_{gc})| = 1$ is called the cross-over frequency $\\omega_{gc}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W_1(j\\omega)$ and $W_2(j\\omega)$ are weighting functions that capture the desired behavior at low and high frequencies, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "These create an \"obstacle course\" on the Bode plot through which we must navigate $L(j\\omega)$. The goal would be to find a loop transfer function that stays between the two curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/obstacle.png\" alt=\"Obstacle\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to design L(jω)L(j\\omega)L(jω) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It stays above W1W_1W1​ at low frequencies\n",
    "   - It stays below W2−1W_2^{-1}W2−1​ at high frequencies\n",
    "   - It transitions smoothly between these bounds near crossover"
