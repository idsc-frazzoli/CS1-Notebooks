    "# Motivation\n",
    "In Lecture 4, we observed that analyzing the time response of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system can be quite challenging. Their time response is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = Ce^{At}x(0) + C\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(t-\\tau)}Bu(\\tau)d\\tau + Du(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula provides a complete characterization of the output response of an LTI system. However, the convolution integral makes it difficult to analyze the system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises the question: how can we effectively analyze the response of a system to more complex inputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we will study the response of LTI systems to elementary inputs such as step and impulse inputs. These inputs are particularly easy to analyze because the input has the same form as the output and are very rich, meaning they can be used to describe any other input through linear combinations.\n"

    "1) First, let's define our RC circuit:\n",
    "   - R is the resistance\n",
    "   - C is the capacitance\n",
    "   - v_c(t) is the voltage across the capacitor (our output)\n",
    "   - v_i(t) is the input voltage\n",

    "2) Using Kirchhoff's laws, we can write the differential equation for the circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$R C \\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt} + v_c(t) = v_i(t)$$\n",
