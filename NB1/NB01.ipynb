    "First we define some relevant terminology:\n",
    "1. **Inputs:** The inputs to a system define how the outside world affects the system itself. This includes both, the general environment and possibly some user with some goal of controlling the system for a specific task.   \n",
    "For example while controlling the temperature of water in a faucet, it is affected by both the user controlling the knob and the heat dissipation in the plumbing.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Inputs can be separated into:\n",
    "   * **Endogenous inputs**: Inputs which can be controlled. These are in general the control inputs (for example the faucet knob or the gas throttle from a car).\n",
    "   * **Exogenous inputs**: Inputs which the user has no control over. These are usually (not always) disturbances (for example wind disturbances when flying a helicopter).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outputs:** The outputs of a system are the measurements or observations we make of the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   These can be separated in:\n",
    "   * **Measured outputs**, quantities we can measure directly (e.g., the speed of a car).\n",
    "   * **Performance outputs**, which we can't measure directly but would also like to control (e.g., the average fuel efficiency of a car).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **System State/memory:**\n",
    "The **memory** of a system, summarizes the effects of all past inputs. We will refer to this as the (internal) **state** of the system. It is a set of numbers and/or quantities describing the system. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   For example, one could describe the state of a car by its position and velocity, $x(t) = [p(t), \\dot p(t)]^T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the above aspects can be controlled while deriving a model, meaning we can choose what quantities will be captured in the model. Thus, to some extent we can choose the inputs to our system and the corresponding outputs to better suit our goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the system below: (Problem Set 1 Question 2 - **add image directly into here**)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model we included the drag force, roll resistance, traction (engine model) and gravity as inputs to the system.   \n",
    "Another valid choice for inputs would be to ignore the drag force and only look at the roll resistance, traction and gravity.   \n",
    "Whether this is a good choice or not depends on the overarching goal, but it would be a valid model of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand one could make the model more complex and introduce the model that calculates the traction torque explicitly.\n",
    "This would increase the scope of the system as new quantities such as temperatures and pressures inside the motor become relevant.\n",
    "This again would be valid but maybe it would be to complicated for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we can also change the outputs of the system. We are not limited to measuring the velocity of the car, but we could instead measure acceleration, or include a GPS device and measure the position explicitly. Again, these are objective dependent considerations that vary according to the context of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the principal objective of the course is to teach how to control said systems, it will be clear by the context what the relevant inputs, outputs and system states are. "

    "Once the system boundaries, inputs and outputs are defined the differential equations of the system need to be derived.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Following is a simulation of the reverse pendulum exercise (PS1 Exercise 3). \n",
    "When you first run the code you can see how the system naturally behaves. It starts upright until at $t=3$ an impulse torque notches the pendulum out of its unstable equilibrium. The pendulum then swings down and approaches its stable equilibrium (being at 180° ($\\pi$ rad)). This is what we would expect from this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the goal is to introduce a feedback controller to stabilize the system to an upright position. \n",
    "For this we will first introduce the simplest controller imaginable. \n",
    "Lets say we want the system to be at the desired angle $\\theta_{ref} = 0$.\n",
    "We can then define the error of the system as the deviation of the angle from the reference angle:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e(t) = \\theta_{ref}-\\theta(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We can then say the controller should input a control signal proportional to the error:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_p(t) = K_p \\cdot e(t)\n",
    "$$.\n",
    "To see what happens you can turn on the controller and increase the $K_p$ slider.\n",
    "One can see that in the beginning the control is not able to reach the desired state of $\\theta = 0$ since to little effort is made.\n",
    "As one increases the $K_p$ gain the controller approaches the desired state of $\\theta = 0$. This is certainly a controller that works but one can see that the controller overshoots. The larger the gain the higher the overshoot. This overshooting (going above or below the desired goal) can be mitigated by introducing a damping term in the controller. For this we calculate the rate of change of the error (i.e. are we make a lot of progress towards the right direction or not). We define:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot e(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta_{ref}- \\theta(t)) \\underbrace{=}_{\\text{since } \\dot \\theta_{ref}\\text{ is zero}} - \\dot \\theta(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We now introduce this term into the control input as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_{PD}(t) = K_p \\cdot e(t) + K_d \\cdot \\dot e(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is a so called PD-Controller which you will encounter later in this course. \n",
    "To see the effect increase the $K_d$ gain slider and see how the system overshoot is smaller.\n",
    "One can interpret this as a sort of damping, when we are moving fast towards the desired goal the controller backs of to \"gently\" approach the desired goal.\n",
    "Feel free to play around with different values of $K_p$ and $K_d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly one can also see the effect of feedback being negative. If the $K_d$ gain is zero and the $K_p$ gain is to large the system starts to become unstable.\n",
    "This nicely demonstrates that one has to be careful when implementing feedback as in the worst case a rogue controller will damage or destroy your system."
